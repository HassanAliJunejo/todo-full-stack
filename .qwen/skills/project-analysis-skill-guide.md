# Project Analysis Skill - Usage Guide

## Purpose
This skill enables comprehensive analysis of complete software projects to understand their structure, technology stack, architecture, and implementation patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the Project Analysis Skill when you need to:

1. **Onboard to a new project** - Quickly understand the codebase structure and technologies used
2. **Perform security audits** - Identify potential vulnerabilities and security implementations
3. **Understand legacy systems** - Reverse engineer existing applications to comprehend their architecture
4. **Plan refactoring efforts** - Assess the current state before making improvements
5. **Evaluate third-party codebases** - Analyze external projects for integration or learning purposes

## How to Apply This Skill

Follow these steps when analyzing a project:

### 1. Initial Exploration
- Examine the root directory for configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Docker files, etc.)
- Identify the main entry points and application initialization code
- Map out the overall directory structure

### 2. Technology Stack Assessment
- Identify frontend, backend, and database technologies
- Recognize framework versions and integration patterns
- Determine deployment and CI/CD configurations

### 3. Architecture Evaluation
- Assess the separation of concerns
- Identify API patterns and communication protocols
- Evaluate security implementations and authentication flows

### 4. Code Quality Review
- Analyze coding standards and conventions
- Identify potential vulnerabilities or anti-patterns
- Evaluate test coverage and quality assurance measures

### 5. Documentation Analysis
- Review README and documentation completeness
- Identify specification documents and design decisions
- Assess onboarding materials for new developers

## Output of Analysis

A complete project analysis should include:

- **Project Overview**: Summary of the application's purpose and functionality
- **Technology Stack**: Detailed breakdown of technologies used
- **Architecture Analysis**: Description of system components and their interactions
- **Security Assessment**: Overview of authentication, authorization, and data protection measures
- **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Identification of positive aspects and areas for improvement
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for enhancements or optimizations
