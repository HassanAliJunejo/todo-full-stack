## Instructions for Use

When analyzing a project:

1. **Start with the root directory** - Examine package.json, requirements.txt, Docker files, etc.
2. **Identify the main entry points** - Find application initialization code
3. **Map dependencies and relationships** - Understand how components interact
4. **Review configuration files** - Understand environment setups and secrets management
5. **Analyze the data flow** - Trace how data moves through the application
6. **Assess security measures** - Look for authentication, authorization, and data validation
7. **Document findings** - Create a comprehensive analysis report
