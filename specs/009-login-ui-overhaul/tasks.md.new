## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (US1) must be completed before US2, US3, and US4 can be fully tested
- Foundational tasks (T004-T006) must be completed before any user story tasks
- Setup tasks (T001-T003) should be completed first

## Parallel Execution Examples

- T002 and T003 can run in parallel as they install/configure different dependencies
- T005 and T006 can run in parallel as they handle different aspects of styling
- T014 and T015 can run in parallel as they create different input fields
- T025 and T026 can run in parallel as they create different social buttons

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (T007-T012) for basic visual overhaul
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Add authentication functionality (User Story 2)
3. **Enhancement**: Add social login (User Story 3) and premium visuals (User Story 4)
4. **Final Polish**: Complete all cross-cutting concerns
